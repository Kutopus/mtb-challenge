To make the Nash Equilibrium easier to understand, we use what is called the "Prisoner's Dilemma", which is an imaginary situation where there are two people the police suspect are partners in the same crime.

In this situation, the police speak to the two suspects separately and propose the following:

1. If both confess to the crime, both face 3 years in prison.
2. If one confesses and the other doesn't, the one who confesses gets 1 year in prison and the one who doesn't get 10
3. If both remain silent, both face 2 years in prison.

It can be said that the two being silent would be better for both, but as one of the prisoners can betray the other, the best individual strategy would be to confess the crime, and both sides would face 3 years in prison, which would lead to the so-called "Nash Equilibrium", as each of the prisoners comes to the conclusion that it is risky to depend on the strategy chosen by the other and have to spend 10 years in prison.
